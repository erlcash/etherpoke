version 2.1.0
-------------

* New configuration option 'monitor_mode'. If enabled and supported by the
network interface, IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs management and control frames
will be accessible.

* Specify read timeout using pcap_set_timeout. On some systems, unspecified
timeout caused the select(2) to freeze.

* If no applicable filters are left to use, die instead of useless pooling.

version 2.0.2
-------------

* validation rules for configuration file

* hook execution is done in 'controlled' manner, transparency of the whole
ordeal was increased

* event hooks that failed to execute are not subsequently reexecuted, entire
filter is freed from the memory

* bug fixes and code cleanup


version 2.0
-----------

* Total redesign of previous version. Almost entire code base was replaced or
removed. Version 2.0 no longer relies on POSIX threads, instead it takes
advantage of events triggered on file descriptors, see select(2). Use of
threads was a huge misstep, it not only made a whole program much more
complicated but also more resource consumming.
