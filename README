etherpoke is a scriptable network session monitor.

etherpoke defines two events: SESSION_BEGIN, SESSION_END to which a hook (system command) can be assigned. The event hook can be any program installed in the system.

SESSION_BEGIN is triggered when the first packet matching the filter rule is captured.

SESSION_END is triggered when the time since the last matching packet was captured exceeds the session timeout.
