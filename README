1. Description
etherpoke is a daemon listening on network interface/s monitoring a session of
devices connected to network.

A list of monitored devices is available in the configuration file.
Each filter contains an Ethernet address of the device, a pair of event hooks
and session timeout.

etherpoke defines two events: SESSION_BEGIN, SESSION_END.

Event SESSION_BEGIN is triggered when the first packet, with source address
matching the filter, is captured.
Event SESSION_END is triggered after the time, since the last captured packet
, with source address matching the filter, exceeds session_timeout.

The value of the event hook can be any program available in the system.
The program is executed by /bin/sh.

Data retrieved and manipulated by etherpoke are Ethernet source address and packet's capture
timestamp.

2. Installation

** THIS SECTION SHOULD BE UPDATED **

I do not recommend using the software, yet. It's still work in progress with
plenty of bugs and design issues (possibly). Automake is not working. If you are
a lazy developer, use:

gcc *.c -o etherpoke -ggdb -Wall -lpcap -lpthread -lconfig

If you are a lazy developer who can't stand using the command, fix it and submit
the changes! I would certainly appreciate it.

3. Configuration
This is an example of configuration file:

common:{
	# Listen on these interfaces
	interfaces = ( "wlan0", "eth0", "eth1", "eth2" );
	
	# How long to wait in seconds before the session expires triggering the event SESSION_END
	# Deprecated, session_timeout is specified separately for each device (filter).
	session_timeout = 1800;
};

filters:{
	# Filter name (use anything relevant)
	b2x2_wifi: {
		mac_addr = "1c:4b:d6:ed:80:60";
		session_begin = "echo 'hello world' >> /tmp/b2x2_wifi.out";
		session_end = "echo 'goodbye world' >> /tmp/b2x2_wifi.out";
		session_timeout = 60; # seconds
	};
	
	my_phone: {
		mac_addr = "20:cf:30:49:4d:30";
		session_begin = "echo 'hello world' >> /tmp/my_phone.out";
		session_end = "echo 'goodbye world' >> /tmp/my_phone.out";
		session_timeout = 25; # seconds
	};
	
	# Other filters...
};
