Description

etherpoke is a scriptable network session monitor.

etherpoke defines two events: SESSION_BEGIN, SESSION_END to which a hook (system command) can be assigned. The event hook can be any program installed in the system.

The events are triggered as following:
SESSION_BEGIN is triggered when the first packet, with Ethernet source address matching the filter is captured.
SESSION_END is triggered when the time, since the last captured packet with Ethernet source address matching the filter exceeds session timeout.

etherpoke is a free software licensed under GNU GPL3. 


TODO ... update for version 2
